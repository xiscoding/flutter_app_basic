# hack_submission 2/5/2023
This is what I submitted to my first hackathon I competed in. 

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
# flutter_app_basic
You may have an easier time creating a new flutter application in VSCode and then copy-pasting the following files into the files VSCode created of the same name:
pubspec.yaml<BR>
analysis_options.yaml<BR>
lib/main.dart<BR>
